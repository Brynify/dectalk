This folder contains the revised dictionary compiler and all of the dictionaries converted
to the new form class format.

Notes about the revised dictionary compiler/dictionaries:

The only file I modified in the folder dtalkdic is dic_comm.c.

The dictionary compiler creates an array of 50000 for storing dictionary entries.  This
seems to be fine for all of the machines we use to build DECtalk, but for a machine with not
much memory, this could cause a problem.

Also, I noticed the dictionary compiler defaults to the file name dic_sp.dic for both forms
of Spanish.  While that's not necessarily a problem, I thought it should be noted.
