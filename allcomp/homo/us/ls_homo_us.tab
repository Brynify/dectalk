Homograph means form class of the homograph does not matter - Only need
to look at word to the left. Form class to the left of the arrow means that
the homograph has been identified as this form class after a suffix strip.

The rules work as follows, the first character on each rule line is either
a bracket [ or a :.  [] rules are applied when a form class strip is found
and : rules are applied when no [] applies.

"[]" multiples leading imply exact form class matches.  [-fc] means
eliminate this type of homograph.  [+fc] means select this type. [-fc]
rules continue on if there is still an abiguity.  / implies context.
Context is the single word to the left of the homograph.
