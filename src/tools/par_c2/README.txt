This is the rule compiler for rules in dapi/src/cmd/par_rule2.par.

You can build the binary in this directory with "make" and call "par_c2"
manually.

You can also just call "make compile" which will build par_c2 if needed
and then compile the rules in dapi/src/cmd/par_rule2.par.

We are missing a documentation for the rule-format, so writing new
rules is currently not really feasible.
