<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">The Stress rise (<B>sr</B>) option indicates the nominal height, in Hz, of a local pitch rise and fall
on each stressed syllable. This rise-fall is added to any hat rise or fall that
is also present. For example, Paul has the sr option set to 32 Hz, resulting in
an f0 rise-fall gesture of 32 Hz over a span of about 150 ms, which is located
on the first and succeeding stressed syllables. However, DECtalk Software
rules reduce the actual height of successive stress rises and falls in each clause
and cause the last stress pulse to occur early so that there is time for the
hat fall during the vowel.
<P>
If the sr option is set too low, the speech sounds monotone within long
phrases. Great changes to the hr and sr options from their default values for each
speaker are not necessary or desirable, except in unusual circumstances.
