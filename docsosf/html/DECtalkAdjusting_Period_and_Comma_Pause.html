<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">At the default speaking rate of 180 WPM, DECtalk Software pauses about half a
second after a period in the text and about a sixth of a second after a comma.
When you change the speaking rate, the pause durations are automatically
adjusted.
<P>
In some situations, you might prefer to change the pause after a period or a
comma without changing the speaking rate. For example, to get DECtalk Software
to read a list of words with a longer pause after each  (to allow the listener
to write them down), use the Period Pause command or the Comma Pause command.

This command adds a period pause of 4,500 ms (4.5 seconds) to the standard
half-second pause that occurs after a period in text. The total pause between
words is about five seconds. The accepted range for the period pause parameter is
-380 to 30,000 ms. A negative value shortens the standard period pause.

<P>
This command adds a comma pause of 4,800 ms (4.8 seconds) to the standard
sixth of a second pause that occurs after a comma in the text at normal speaking
rate. The total pause between words separated by a comma is about five seconds.
The accepted range for the comma pause parameter is -40 to 30,000 ms. Values
specified outside this range are limited to the nearest legal value.

values.
