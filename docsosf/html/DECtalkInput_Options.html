<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">Text to be passed to DECtalk Software before the normal input. The prefix text
is &quot;forced&quot; out before the input text is read.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">-post postText
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">Text to be passed to DECtalk Software after the normal input. 
<BR>This is useful for passing terminating commands to DECtalk Software that would
normally not be part of the input. If the postfix text has spaces, it must be
enclosed in quotes. An example would be &quot;[:phoneme off]&quot; or &quot;The End&quot;.
<BR>The &quot;normal&quot; input is &quot;forced&quot; out before the postfix text is read.
<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">text
<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">Text appearing on the command line is spoken. The text to be spoken can come
either from the standard input or from the command line.
<BR>Anything on the command line that is not an option is interpreted as text, as
will anything following it on the command line. In other words, text to be
spoken must appear on the command line after all options.
<BR>If the *first* word in the text has a dash (-) or slash (/) as its first
character, you must precede it with another dash or slash. For example, to tell
DECtalk to say the number -123, you would type the following command:
<BR>SAY --123
<BR>This is necessary to avoid having <B>Say</B> interpret the number as a command line option. If you embed DECtalk commands
into your text, you must enclose them in quotes if they contain spaces.
<BR>This is because <B>Say</B> treats each space-delimited command-line argument as a separate &quot;word&quot;, while
DECtalk commands must be processed as single &quot;words&quot; by the <B>Say</B> program.
<BR>If no text is specified, <B>Say</B> takes its input from the standard input. For example, you could have <B>Say</B> speak a directory listing in Betty's voice by typing the following:
<BR>DIR | SAY -pre &quot;[:nb]&quot;
<BR>Or you could just type the command <B>Say
<BR></B>and then enter text at the console. In this case, <B>Say</B> speaks each line after you press Enter and exits after you press Ctrl/z. If
you want <B>Say</B> to take its input from a file, use file redirection as in the following
example, which reads the file foo.txt  in Harry's voice:
<BR>SAY -pre &quot;[:nh]&quot; &lt; FOO.TXT
