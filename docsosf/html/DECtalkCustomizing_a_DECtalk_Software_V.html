</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">The DECtalk Software built-in voices provide an adequate selection for most
applications. However, if you have a special application requiring a monotone or
unusual voice, you can use the Design Voice command to modify the voice control
options and design your own voice.

The following topics describe how use the Design Voice command to customize a
DECtalk Software voice:

</A>Of the 28 options, only a few cause dramatic changes in the voice. The
greatest effects are obtained with changes to the hs, ap, pr, and sx options, while
moderate changes occur when modifying the la and br options. To some extent,
DECtalk Software's nine predefined speakers cover most of the possible voices,
however, you might easily find ways to slightly improve one of the standard voices.
