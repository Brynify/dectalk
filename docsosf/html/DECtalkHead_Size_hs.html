</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Head size (<B>hs</B>) option is specified as the average size for an adult man (if sx = 1) or an
adult woman (if sx = 0). A head size of 100% is normal or average for a given
sex, but people can differ significantly in this characteristic. Head size has a
strong influence on a person's voice. Large musical instruments produce low
notes, and humans with large heads tend to have low, resonant voices. For example,
to make Paul sound like a larger man with a 15% longer vocal tract (and
formant frequencies that are scaled down by a factor of about 0.85%), use the
following command:

</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Head size is one of the best variables to use if you want to make dramatic
voice changes. For example, Paul has a head size of 100, while Harry's deep voice
is caused in part by a head-size change to 115, or 15% greater than normal.
Decreasing head size produces a higher voice, such as in a child or adolescent.
Extreme changes in head size, as in the following examples, are somewhat
difficult to understand.

<BR></B>Extreme changes in head size can cause overloads, as well as difficulties in
understanding the speech. The modification of certain options such as f4, f5,
and g1 can help to correct this problem.
