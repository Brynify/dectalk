</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Multi-language programming using DECtalk Software requires loading a DECtalk
language, selecting a loaded language for a program thread, starting a TTS
instance, closing the program thread, and closing that language. Swapping a language
requires shutting down and closing the thread and the language selector. You
can load as many languages as you want during the execution of your program as
well as select two or more languages concurrently. The following steps summarize
the methodology to start, select, and close a single language.

static engine does not support multi-language programming.
