</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">The default speaking rate is 180 words per minute (WPM). DECtalk Software
speaking rates range from 75 to 600 WPM. In the Rate command, valid speaking rates
are between 75 and 600. Rates specified outside this range are limited to the
nearest legal value. Speaking rates can be adjusted to very slow, very fast, or
anywhere in between by using the following commands:

<P>
Although the slowest possible rate is 75 WPM, 120 WPM is ideal for information
such as phone numbers which need to be copied down by a listener. Unless the
listener is actually copying down each numeral it might be frustrating to listen
to extended speech at slow rates.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> [:rate 160] 
<P>
This rate is moderate (160 WPM). It sounds a little slow, but is sometimes
preferred when DECtalk Software is speaking math equations or long lists of
acronyms.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> [:rate 180] 
<P>
This is the default rate for DECtalk Software (180 WPM). This rate is ideal
for listening to continuous text under optimal conditions.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> [:rate 240] 
<P>
Experienced listeners may prefer to skim material at this rate (240 WPM).
Inexperienced listeners may not understand every word at this rate.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> [:rate 350] 
<P>
This rate (350 WPM) is too fast to follow, but can be used to quickly scan
sections of text.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> [:rate 550] 
<P>
This rate (550 WPM) is the fastest usable<I> </I>rate. It is too fast for most people to follow, but can be used to scan text
very quickly. 
<P>
Changes in the speaking rate influence the duration and the number of pauses
in text, as well as the duration of individual phonemes. At rates below 140 WPM,
DECtalk Software inserts pauses at all phrase boundaries and pauses, and
inserts phonemes near the ends of phrases. At rates faster than 240 WPM, DECtalk
Software deletes all pauses and shortens phonemes.

fast speaking rates.
