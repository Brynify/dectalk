<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> </B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">If the value in a [:dv] command is too low, DECtalk Software uses the minimum
valid value. If the value is too high, it uses the maximum valid value.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> After you enter a command, that command applies to the remaining text until it
is overridden by another command. For example, the command [:nk] invokes Kit</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="4">’</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">s voice on all entered text until you enter another voice-selection command.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> Invalid commands are ignored. By setting the [:error speak] command, you can
receive an <I>audible</I> warning that an invalid command has been entered.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> Do not put arpabet parameters within the brackets for another command.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> DECtalk Software interprets text between brackets as </FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="DECtalkphoneme.html">phonemes</A></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4"> only after the [:</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="4"><A HREF="DECtalkphoneme_arpabet_command.html">phoneme arpabet</A></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4"> speak on]<I> </I>command has been sent to the application. If [:phoneme arpabet speak on] has
not been sent, DECtalk Software interprets the brackets and characters between
them literally. The [:phoneme arpabet speak off] command must be sent with
actual characters if you want to insert brackets in normal text.
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> If the command [:phoneme arpabet speak on]<I> </I>is set and you forget the right bracket ( ] ), DECtalk Software attempts to
interpret all text following the ASCII text as phonemes, skipping over illegal
letter combinations. The resulting text sounds garbled. Enter a right bracket to
fix this problem.
