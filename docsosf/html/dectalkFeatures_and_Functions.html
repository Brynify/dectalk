<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">DECtalk Software enables applications to extend  the capabilities of your
personal computer by turning text files into spoken words.  With only a standard PC
sound card for audio output, the programming resources provided by DECtalk
Software allow applications to accurately read ASCII text from a variety of
sources, such as electronic mail and word processors. Nine different voices are
provided, and users can control voice pitch, rate of speech, and word or phrase
emphasis. 
<P>
<B>Latest Version of Speech-Synthesis Technology
<P>
</B>DECtalk Software contains the latest version of DECtalk Software speech
synthesis. This incorporates a number of improvements from earlier versions of
DECtalk and is a software-only version.
<P>
<B>Letter Mode, Word Mode, and Clause Mode
<P>
</B>DECtalk Software can speak single characters immediately, without waiting for
an entire clause to be buffered. DECtalk Software also provides normal clause
buffering for natural speech. DECtalk Software can speak letters, words,
phrases, clauses, paragraphs, and whole documents. DECtalk Software allows the
application to terminate speech immediately instead of waiting for the buffered text
to complete processing. 
<P>
<B>Short Command Strings
<P>
</B>Many of the command strings can be abbreviated for greater ease of use in
applications. 
<P>
<B>High-Quality Speech and Word Pronunciation Accuracy
<P>
</B>DECtalk Software speech retains its high quality. In addition, functionality
and acoustic phonetic quality are improved.  Also, DECtalk Software has a large
built-in dictionary that enables accurate pronunciation of individual words as
well as enhancing their rhythmic naturalness. 
<P>
<B>Pronunciation Heuristics
<P>
</B>DECtalk Software includes pronunciation heuristics that recognize and parse
unpronounceable sequences, such as sequences of uppercase initials (FBI, AAA, and
so forth) and sequences with no vowels (CBS, NBC, for example).
