<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">DECtalk Software can choose the correct pronunciation by itself. For example,
if you enter the following sentences:
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="3">He produced a lot of <I>REFUSE</I>. He <I>REFUSE</I>d the produce.
<P>
He <I>INSERTS</I> 5 <I>INSERTS</I> per minute. He <I>DELIBERATE</I>d <I>DELIBERATE</I>ly for a long time.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Generally, DECtalk Software correctly selects the proper homograph. However,
in certain unique context, the following user intervention may be needed: 
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> Replace the correct spelling of the word with a clever misspelling.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="3">I red yesterday that . . .
<P>
<IMG SRC="DECtalk00090000.gif" ALT="DECtalk00090000.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=6 HEIGHT=16> </FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Spell the word phonetically.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="3">I [r'ehd] yesterday that . . .
<P>
<HR></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3"><B>Note
<BR></B>For words that have two pronunciations (homographs), see the Homograph tables
found in the Homographs section.
<P>
<HR></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Additionally, use the following steps to optimize spoken text.
<P>
1. If the word is a compound, use a hyphenated spelling to help DECtalk Software
see the two parts of the compound.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="3">The slide-show host . . .
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">2. Replace the text version by a phonemic string. Use the commands and phonemic
symbols, but make sure to place the lexical stress pattern correctly.
<P>
<HR> </FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3"><B>Note
<BR></B>Sometimes, a word does not sound quite right even when the best phonemic
representation is selected. Usually, such subtle pronunciation defects are not
correctable.
<P>
<HR></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">3. Now that each word is pronounced in the best possible way, listen to the total
sentence rhythm and accent pattern. If it is not right, follow these steps.
<P>
(a) If it sounds like there should be a short pause in a particular sentence
location, but DECtalk Software says the sentence without a pause, insert a comma
between the words in question.
<P>
(b) If the wrong word is emphasized in the sentence, emphasize the word that is
suppose to take the emphasis with the correct stress symbols. 
<P>

<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">(c)  Use the stress symbols; slash [/], backslash [\], and slash and backslash
[/ \] to make final adjustments. 
<P>

<P>
(d) If none of these actions gives you a satisfactory sentence, you can still
specify duration and fundamental frequency motions for all phonemes with the Design
Voice command.
