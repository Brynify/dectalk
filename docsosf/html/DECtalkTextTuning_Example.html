<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Although DECtalk Software allows for natural text-to-speech synthesis, the
quality of speech can often be enhanced by giving it a more natural flow. Much of
this tuning involves strategic placement of commas and periods, which tell the
application to pause. The spoken language and written text are different since
spoken text generally does not contain information about pausing. 
<P>
The text that follows is presented twice, the first time as originally written
and the second time after phonemic and textual fixes were applied.

While they were gone, a beautiful young lady snuck into the bedroom through an
open window.

<P>
[:np] A woman kneeling with her left ear firmly placed against a large rock
responded.
<P>
[:nu] No. No one passed this way. I've been listening for earthquakes all
morning, but have only spotted three bears searching for honey.
