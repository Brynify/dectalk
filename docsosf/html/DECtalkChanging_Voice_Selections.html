</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">You can change a speaking voice by inserting DECtalk Software commands into
the edit window displayed in the Sample applet dialog <I>or</I> by selecting text and then selecting a different name from the Voice
pull-down menu in the Sample applet dialog. Voice changes made with commands are
permanent for the session and remain intact as long as the command remains in the
file. Voice changes made from the menu only remain in effect as long as the
current DECtalk Software session is running.

the speaking voice. 
<P>
You can change voices with a command as in the following example.

</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">If a voice-change request occurs in the middle of a sentence, DECtalk Software
automatically pauses. The pause is the equivalent of inserting a comma, or
about half a second.
