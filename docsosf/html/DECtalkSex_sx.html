</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Male and female voices differ in many ways, including head size, pharynx
length, larynx mass, and speaking habits such as degree of breathiness, liveliness
of pitch, choice of articulatory target values, and speed of articulation. Some
of these differences are under the control of a single option, sx, the sex of
the speaker.  Speakers Paul, Harry, Frank, and Dennis are male (sx = 1), while
speakers Betty, Rita, Ursula, Wendy, and Kit are female (sx = 0).  Actually, Kit
can be male or female because children of both sexes younger than 10 years old
have similar voices.
<P>
Changing the Sex (<B>sx</B>) option causes DECtalk Software to access a different (male or female) table
of target values for formant frequencies, bandwidths, and source amplitudes.
The male and female tables are patterned after two individuals who were judged to
have pleasant, intelligible voices. DECtalk Software built-in voices are
simply scaled transformations of Paul and Betty, the two basic voices.
<P>
You can change the sex of any of DECtalk Software's voices by making the voice
current and then modifying the sx option. For example, the following command
gives Paul some of the speaking characteristics of a woman. (The sx option does
not change the average pitch or breathiness, so a peculiar combination of
simultaneous male and female traits results from this sx change.)

[:dv sx f].

<BR>If you change the sex of the voice, some phonemes might cause DECtalk
Software's filters to overload, producing a squawk. The modification of certain options
such as f4, f5, and g1 can help to correct this problem.
