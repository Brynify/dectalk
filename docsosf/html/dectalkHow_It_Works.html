through a speech synthesizer. The two ways to feed text into the speech synthesizer
are:

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">A sentence parser breaks the input stream into separate words and locates some
clause boundaries (indicated by commas and other punctuation marks as well as
by special words loaded in the DECtalk Software internal dictionary). The
sentence parser also recognizes and deals with phonemic symbols and commands that
you might have added to the input text.
<BR>A word parser breaks words into their component parts, dividing words by their
final pronounceable form. Strings of text that do not form pronounceable
English words are spelled out letter by letter. A number formatter is used if the
text contains numerals. The number formatter applies the rules for many common
number formats and converts the numbers into English words.

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">A dictionary lookup routine searches the pronunciation dictionaries. DECtalk
Software has a built-in dictionary of many commonly used words. DECtalk Software
also has a user dictionary for programmers and general users that can be
filled with words specific to an application. This dictionary and how to load it are
described in Chapter 3. 
<BR>A letter-to-sound module uses a set of English pronunciation rules to assign
phonemic form and lexical stress patterns to words not found in the dictionary.
See Chapter 3 for more information on modifying the phonemic form of words, and <I>the DECtalk Software Reference Guide</I> for enhancing special voice qualities, such as emphasis and singing.

<BR></FONT></TD><TD><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3">A phrase structure module recombines all phonemic output from the dictionary
search and other modules. Duration of phonemes and pitch commands is computed
for the clause, and appropriate sound variants are selected for those phonemes
that can be pronounced in more than one way.
<BR>The phoneme-to-voice module processes clauses passed from the phrase structure
module and converts them to control signals for the speech synthesizer. This
module modifies the clauses by changing the phonemes/allophones into parameters
that determine the natural resonant frequencies of the vocal tract (formants),
and sound source amplitudes. The control parameters are sent to the speech
synthesizer for output.
