<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">The Loudness of voice (<B>g5</B>) option is set to about the same perceived loudness for each of the
predefined voices.  The values chosen are optimal for telephone conversation and are
near the maximum value beyond which some phonemes would probably cause an overload
squawk. A near-maximum value was selected to maximize the signal-to-noise
level of DECtalk Software.
<P>
If you want to decrease the loudness of a voice or temporarily increase a
phrase that is known not to overload, determine the g5 option value in dB for the
voice in question. Then adjust the voice by using the following commands:
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE="3">[:np][:dv g5 76] I am speaking at about half my normal level.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">Because the g5 option value for Paul is 86, this command reduces loudness by
10 dB. Perceived loudness approximately doubles (or halves) for each 10 dB
increment (or decrement) in the g5 option.
<P>
Software control over loudness is useful in a loudspeaker application where
the background noise level in the room might change. For example, a vocally
handicapped, wheelchair-bound person does not want to appear to be shouting in a
quiet interpersonal conversation, but he or she may want to be able to converse in
a noisy room as well.
<P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3"><B>Note
<BR></B> DECtalk Software comes with volume control so that modification of the g5
option should not be necessary. Using the </FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" COLOR="#008000" SIZE="3"><A HREF="DECtalkVolume_volume.html">Volume command</A></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="3"> or the volume control knob on the external loudspeaker is recommended.
