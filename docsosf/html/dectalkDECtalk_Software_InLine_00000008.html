<P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="HELVETICA" SIZE="4">DECtalk Software includes in-line commands that control voice characteristics.
You can use these commands to perform simple voice-control operations, such as
changing the speaking rate or speaking voice while DECtalk Software is
speaking. In-line commands can be inserted into the text entered into the text window
or box available in most application supplied with DECtalk Software.  In-line
commands also can be included in data buffers passed to the DECtalk Software
DLLs by way of various TextToSpeech...() API calls.  For more information, see the <I>DECtalk Software Reference Guide</I>.
<P>
DECtalk Software also has a more complex set of voice-control commands to
modify the characteristics of each voice, control intonation and stress within
written text, or to create special effects, such as singing. 
<P>
In-line commands have special syntax rules and components that you need to use
when you insert them into files. A few simple commands and command components
are illustrated below. Refer to the <I>DECtalk Software Reference Guide</I> for more information on in-line commands<I>.

always inserted between brackets. (The command here tells DECtalk Software to
speak this line at 150 words per minute.) Most commands can have parameters (For
example, : rate 150  = rate of 150 words per minute).

enclosed within a set of square brackets.  (For example, [r </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">’</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> iyl iy] for <I>really</I>) Note: if you want to use phonetic spelling, you must use the [:phoneme
arpabet speak on] command to turn on recognition of phonetic spelling.
